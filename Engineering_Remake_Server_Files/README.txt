This modpack uses multiple forge launchers and several mods Windows Firewall deems as trojans/malware! To prevent crashing or world corruption please set the folder as an exemption in your firewall settings!

Do not attempt to add anymore mods (map mods, waypoint mods) they will screw up the autorun and quicklaunch.bat and will corrupt your game!
